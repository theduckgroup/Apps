# Intro

This project hosts multiple apps. Each app has a folder on front-end and back-end with routing and everything.

Each iOS app have their own folder.

# Server

- To run: npm run nodemon

# Webapp

- To run: npm run dev
- To build & watch for changes: npm run build-watch

vite.config.js:
- Dev server runs on port 8022
- Dev server forwards request starting `/api` to server
- For prod, the app is built with output at Server/public folder

Notes:
- bson package is locked to version 4 because bson@5 and @6 rely on top-level await, which is not available
- useCallback is important if you are using functions as dependencies for useEffect; this is because  every time the 
component changes, a new function is created!
- StrictMode causes components to be mounted twice, so requests will be fired twice, and maybe same for websockets
